# Challenge 02: Maximum Value
### This method takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum value found within the array.
#### 1. Initialization: The method initializes an integer variable `max` to `arr[0]`.
#### 2. Iteration: It iterates through each element in the input array using a `for` loop.
#### 3. Comparison: During each iteration, it compares the current element of the array (`arr[i]`) with `max`.
#### - If the current element is greater than `max`, it updates `max` to this element.
#### 4. Return: After completing the iteration over the array, it returns the value of `max` which now holds the maximum value found in the array.
