# Insert Value in Middle of Array

### Description:
##### The problem requires writing a function called `MiddleValue` that takes an array and a value, then returns a new array with the value inserted at the middle index. The function should not use any built-in array methods. The middle index should be rounded up if the array length is even. The task involves creating a new array, iterating through the original array, and placing the value at the correct position to achieve the desired output.
