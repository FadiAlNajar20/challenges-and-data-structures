# Binary Tree - Largest Value at Each Level

### **Problem Domain**
Implement a method `LargestLevelValue()` in a binary tree class that returns a list of the largest values at each level of the binary tree. This method should traverse the tree level by level (using breadth-first traversal) and keep track of the maximum value at each level.
